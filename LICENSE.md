## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

## 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any accompanying warranty disclaimers are part of this License; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

## 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

- a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
- b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

## 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

- a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
    - 1) Accompany it with the object code or executable form of the Program on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
    - 2) Offer access to copy the corresponding source code from a designated place (this is usually a good idea to do on the internet).
- b) Distribute the object code or executable form solely as part of an aggregate software distribution that contains the Program and is distributed under the terms of this License.

## 4. You are not allowed to impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for this License or for works based on the Program.

## 5. The Program is distributed "as is", without any warranty of any kind. The author(s) are not liable for any damages arising from the use of the Program.

## 6. If you cannot comply with this License, you will not be permitted to use the Program. However, if you have not violated this License, you will not lose your rights under it.

## 7. This License shall be governed by the laws of the Germany and the United States of America.

## 8. If you have questions about this License, please contact the Free Software Foundation at <https://www.fsf.org>.
